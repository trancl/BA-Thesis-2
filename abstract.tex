This study investigates the distributional patterns of phonetic segments in initial, medial, and final positions across 20 diverse languages. 
Through an analysis of the top 20 segments, including nasals, stops, fricatives, and glottal stops, certain universal tendencies and language-specific idiosyncrasies are uncovered.
Most noticeable is the high symmetricity of nasals 
Despite the study's limited scope, resemblances to larger surveys indicate cross-linguistic representativity, while language-specific patterns and exceptions underscore the necessity for nuanced analyses tailored to individual languages
